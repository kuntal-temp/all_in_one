# Type of data structure :

* Linear Data Structure [lists, stack, queue, etc.]
* Non-Linear Data Structure [tree, graph, table, etc.]



# Hash Collision
When the hash function generates the same index for multiple keys, there will 
be a conflict (what value to be stored in that index). This is called a hash collision.

A good hash function may not prevent the collisions completely however 
it can reduce the number of collisions.


1. Collision resolution by chaining
2. Linear Probing
3. Quadratic Probing
4. Double hashing



# Heap
A Heap is a special Tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

* Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
* Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of its children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
