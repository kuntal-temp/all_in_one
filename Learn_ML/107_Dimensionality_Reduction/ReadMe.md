The curse of dimensionality basically means that the error increases with the increase in the number of features

Dimensionality reduction is a method of converting the high dimensional variables into lower dimensional variables without changing the specific information of the variables. To overcome the issue of the curse of dimensionality, Dimensionality Reduction is used to reduce the feature space with consideration by a set of principal features. Dimensionality Reduction contains no extra variables that make the data analyzing easier and simple for machine learning algorithms and resulting in a faster outcome from the algorithms.
